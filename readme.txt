<blockquote>
<p><strong>September 14, 2015 - WPSSO Replaces NextGEN Facebook (NGFB)</strong></p>
<p>NextGEN Facebook (NGFB) is being replaced by the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization</a> (WPSSO) plugin. WPSSO is a fork / child of NGFB &mdash; they have the same author, the same core features and code-base, but WPSSO is distributed without the sharing buttons and their related features (making WPSSO about 25% smaller than NGFB). Additional extension plugins are also available for WPSSO, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/">WPSSO Mobile App Meta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-plm/">WPSSO Place and Location Meta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/">WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons</a></li>

= Social Sharing Buttons =

NGFB comes with several sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on Post / Page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, as a sidebar, widget, shortcode, or even call a function from your theme template(s). Each of the following sharing buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* **Buffer**
* **Facebook** (Like, Send, and Share)
* **Google+**
* **LinkedIn**
* **ManageWP**
* **Pinterest**
* **Reddit**
* **StumbleUpon**
* **Tumblr** (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* **Twitter**

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter sharing buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the sharing button language with the webpage language / WordPress locale. NGFB can also include hashtags from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names in the Open Graph (Facebook) and Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

</div>

= Social Profiles for Google Search =

NGFB provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles">author (Person) and publisher (Organization) social profiles</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/logos">publisher (Organization) logo</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/site-name">WebSite Site Name</a> in schema.org JSON-LD format for Google Search and their <em>Knowledge Graph</em>. The author (Person) markup includes the author's website URL, their profile social sharing image, and all listed contact URLs from their user profile. The publisher (Organization) markup includes the website URL, a corporate logo, a default image, and the publisher Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter business pages.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

= User Profile Social Contacts =

NGFB allows you to customize (Pro version) the field names, label, and add / remove the following contacts from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook URL
* Google+ URL
* Instagram URL
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn URL
* MySpace URL
* Pinterest URL
* Skype Username
* Tumblr URL
* Twitter @username
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube Channel URL

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

NGFB adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) (Facebook), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and all social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). NGFB is a complete social sharing solution that uses the *existing* content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags &mdash; There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available). <a href="http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/">See examples from Google Search, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, etc.</a> &mdash; along with screenshots of the NGFB settings pages.

NGFB provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary), [Summary with Large Image](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary-large-image), and [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player) Twitter Cards &mdash; *including configurable image sizes for each card type*. The [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/photo), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/gallery), and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/product) Twitter Cards were deprecated by Twitter on July 3rd, 2015.

= 3rd Party Integration (Pro version) =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the NGFB Free and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

NGFB (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

<blockquote id="changelog_top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). 
New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. 
When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released.
This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
